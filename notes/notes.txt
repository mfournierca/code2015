PROJECT:

A tool to help young people choose their major

Visualize which fields of study map to which fields of employment and rate of employment, in which times / places.

That comes down to:

- display employment rate
    - filter by industry sector, field of study, geo region, age, date, sex.

Major things I want is what they studied and what industry they work in.

DATA QUALITY ISSUES:

Structure Doc: Structure_99-012-X2011047
Line 7001:

Disclosure control rules have been applied to data tables ... subtotals will not necessarily aggregate to the total. As well ... random rounding has also been applied to the data.



TECHNICAL CHALLENGES:

- the data files are huge, up to 150GB
- xml artificially inflates the size of the data set, need a sax parser


PLAN OF ATTACK:

- use a sax parse to go through the documents and dump to a csv file
- dump csv file to db
- build your app using sql statements on the db
